## **About me**
*I am 23 years old and I am a medical physicist by education. During the training, we had a programming course in Pascal and Delphi. At that time, I didn't think that I will be interested in programming sometime. By the time I graduated from university, I was disappointed in my choice of profession and started looking for myself. And now I'm here. I consider my weakness to be high anxiety about a lot of things. But because of this quality, my strong character traits come from. I am very responsible, I always finish what I start. I work with people and thanks to this I have improved my communication skills and stress resistance. I am very interested in becoming a frontend developer. Programming for me has become the business I dreamed of.*
